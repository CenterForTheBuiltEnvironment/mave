Mave
======
Mave is a tool for automated measurement and verification. At it's most simple, the aim is to read energy consumption data from before and after a retrofit (pre-retrofit and post-retrofit data) and to predict how much energy the retrofit saved. Mave does this by training a model(s) to the data and using that model to predict energy consumption during a different period. Mave uses three different approaches to do this.


Installation
======
Assuming all of the dependencies are installed, install mave from source using:
    python setup.py install

Alternatively, install mave from pypi using:
    pip install mave --no-deps

If you run into trouble with the dependencies, see the Installation page of the wiki on github here: https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/mave/wiki/Installation


Usage
=====
Try mave out on an example file using:
    mave ex3.csv -v

Mave has many configurable options (e.g. -v for verbose output) which can be passed as command line arguments or using a separate config file. Review the wiki documentation for more details.
